# Project Title

### Credit where credit is due

This project leverages the [Auto1111 SDK Python library](https://github.com/Auto1111SDK/Auto1111SDK) for seamless integration. Show your appreciation by visiting its [GitHub page](https://github.com/Auto1111SDK/Auto1111SDK) or exploring its [Google Colab demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SekiJ-mdB2V8ogWbyRyF_yDnoMuDGWTl#scrollTo=Eobx7Cy4zPkL).

**Important**

If this is your initial encounter with this Colab environment and models on your drive, kindly adhere to the instructions under the 'Models' section.

1. Click on "Install Library" to initiate the installation. If Google Colab prompts you to restart, please follow through with the restart process.
2. Execute the "Load Google Drive" cell and grant the necessary permissions to establish a connection between your drive and the project.
3. Click "Load Project" to complete the setup process.

You are now ready to engage with the project through two primary approaches:

1. Use a single prompt without the need for a negative prompt.
2. Combine one prompt with a corresponding negative prompt.

For a more advanced experience, consider exploring the additional settings, as detailed instructions are still being incorporated.

## Models (First-time Setup)

To optimize efficiency and reduce download time, we recommend storing the model on your Google Drive.

If you prefer a custom directory path, feel free to use it, or follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/my-drive) and create a folder named "AI."
2. Inside the "AI" folder, create another folder named "Models."

### Download and Save Model

Instead of repeatedly downloading the model online and utilizing Google's bandwidth, save the model directly to your drive.

For simplicity, follow these steps:

1. Access your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/my-drive).
2. Create a folder named "AI" and then, within this folder, create another folder named "Models."

Before proceeding, download the [DreamShapers](https://civitai.com/models/4384/dreamshaper) model. In the future, efforts will be made to simplify the model download process.
